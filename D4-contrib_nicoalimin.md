Important Commits:
We basically did d4 and d5 side by side (literally, for hours and hours and hours), so we did everything together.

I put too much commit I forgot what I did.. And I pushed very very often since we need our code to be exactly the same
most of the time

What went well: We finished the project! Yay! We managed to do this in time, and seemingly succeeded in the specs given
What went poorly: As usual, time is an issue because we did everything last minute.
How will I approach the next deliverable: Make a better timeline, and find enough motivation to go through it.
