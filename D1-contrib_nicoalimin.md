What went well: We divided the work evenly, and there is a lot of communication along the course of the project
What went poorly: Starting early is a very hard thing to do for the both of us. We have many other assignments and at the end we start making a week before the deadline.
How will I approach the next deliverable: Plan ahead, and STICK TO IT!
