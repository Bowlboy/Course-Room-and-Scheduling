Important Commits:
I implemented the parseQuery function, so it is more robuset towards the changes in datasets and
addition towards the variables that needs to be computed. I also made the D2Spec test file

What went well: We set a pretty good deadline, and we have a clear path towards what we want to achieve since the beginning, so there are no problems at all
What went poorly: Going at the same pace as the deadline remains to be a challenge, as we both got a slow start, especially because of reading week
How will I approach the next deliverable: I have to set a good goal, and stick to it!
