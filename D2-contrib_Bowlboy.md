Basically, we divided the work into add + remove or query
I handle the add and remove while my partner handle the query

Went	well	: We got things to work or some at least, we handled conflict well and can communicate on push and pulling well, we lay down clearly on what the file at disk format is and communicate if there is any problem or changes 

Went	poorly	: Definetly need to strat earlier, didn't finish some parts.

next approach	: Start earlier, go to more OH or lab
