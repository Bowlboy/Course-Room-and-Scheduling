I did the REST while my partner did the Query

Went	well	: We got things to work or some at least, we handled conflict well and can communicate on push and pulling well, we lay down clearly on what the file at disk format is and communicate if there is any problem or changes

next approach	: Start earlier, go to more OH or lab
